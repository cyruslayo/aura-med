Data Engineering & Validation Plan: Aura-Med1. OverviewThe Aura-Med validation strategy ensures the multimodal system—combining HeAR acoustic features with MedGemma clinical reasoning—is safe, robust, and accurate. This document outlines the data sources, preprocessing pipelines, and clinical benchmarking metrics required for a winning Kaggle submission and real-world deployment.2. Primary Data SourcesDatasetModalityPrimary Use CaseKey Labels/FeaturesCODA TB (2025)Audio (Solicited)TB Triage Fine-tuningMicrobiologic TB status, Demographic metadata (Age, Sex, Region).ICBHI 2017Audio (Auscultation)Pneumonia DetectionCrackles, Wheezes, Breath cycle segmentation.MIMIC-IV-EDText (Vitals)Reasoning LogicRespiratory Rate (RR), Oxygen Saturation ($SpO_2$), Clinical Outcomes.COUGHVID v3Audio (Crowdsourced)Noise RobustnessBackground noise (market, wind, crying) for augmentation.3. Data Preprocessing Pipeline (The "Cleaner")Engineers must implement this pipeline to ensure HeAR and MedGemma receive consistent inputs.3.1 Audio NormalizationResampling: Convert all files to 16kHz Mono.Segmentation: Extract 2-second "Cough Bouts" or 10-second respiratory cycles.Denoising: Apply Log-Spectral Subtraction to remove stationary background noise typical of rural clinics.3.2 Multimodal AlignmentLabel Mapping: Convert ICBHI acoustic labels (Crackle=1, Wheeze=1) into descriptive text strings for the Acoustic Interpreter.Tokenization: Use the MedGemma SentencePiece tokenizer to prepare clinical vitals and WHO instruction sets.4. Evaluation Metrics (The "Scorecard")To win the Kaggle Impact Challenge, your validation must go beyond "Accuracy." We will use clinical metrics that matter to the WHO.4.1 Primary MetricsSensitivity (Recall): Crucial for not missing a case of Pneumonia. Target: >90%.Specificity: Crucial for not overwhelming hospitals with false positives. Target: >70%.F1-Score: The harmonic mean to balance the imbalanced nature of rare diseases.4.2 Edge Performance Metrics (Edge AI Prize)Inference Latency: Target <5 seconds per triage on mobile NPUs.Memory Peak: Target <4GB RAM to ensure compatibility with older Android devices.5. Clinical Validation Plan (Pólya Step 4: Looking Back)Once the model is trained, the team must perform a "Silent Clinical Trial" using held-out data:Benchmark vs. WHO Standards: Compare the model’s triage level (Red/Yellow/Green) against a ground-truth dataset of 500 pediatric cases manually labeled by senior clinicians.Robustness Testing: Run the model through the "Noise Stress Test" (adding market and wind noise from COUGHVID) to see how much the HeAR embeddings degrade.Reasoning Audit: Manually review 50 "Reasoning Traces" to ensure the model isn't recommending antibiotics for viral colds (Antimicrobial Stewardship).6.
