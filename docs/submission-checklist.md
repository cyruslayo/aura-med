This Final Submission Checklist is designed to ensure you hit the maximum points across all five judging pillars of the MedGemma Impact Challenge. Since we are targeting the Edge AI Special Prize, we have added specific technical requirements for that track.

The "Winning Submission" Checklist
1. Effective Use of HAI-DEF (20%)
[ ] Multimodal Synergy: Does the documentation clearly explain the bridge between HeAR (audio) and MedGemma (reasoning)?

[ ] Model Selection: Is the choice of MedGemma 2B justified for the edge/offline requirement?

[ ] Full Potential: Have you demonstrated that MedGemma is doing more than just "chatting"—is it performing complex WHO-aligned triage?

2. Problem Domain & Importance (20%)
[ ] Clear Protagonist: Is the "Aminat" (Community Health Worker) persona central to the narrative?

[ ] Magnitude: Does the write-up cite the 2026 mortality statistics for pediatric pneumonia in the target region?

[ ] The "Unmet Need": Is it clear that current tools (or lack thereof) are failing this specific user?

3. Potential Real-World Impact (15%)
[ ] The "Shift": Can you quantify the improvement? (e.g., "A 70% reduction in diagnostic delay").

[ ] Scalability: Does the plan address how this could be deployed across thousands of rural clinics?

[ ] Safety: Are there built-in guardrails (like the uncertainty logic-gates) to prevent clinical harm?

4. Product Feasibility (20%)
[ ] Edge Optimization: Have you included the LiteRT/TFLite conversion path?

[ ] Performance Audit: Does the write-up include latency and RAM benchmarks on a real mobile device?

[ ] Offline Proof: Is the "No-Internet" requirement documented as a core technical constraint?

5. Execution & Communication (25%)
[ ] The 3-Minute Video: * [ ] Does it start with the problem (emotional hook)?

[ ] Is the app demo polished and visible?

[ ] Does it explain the "multimodal" logic simply?

[ ] The 3-Page Write-up: Does it follow the Kaggle template exactly? (No more than 3 pages).

[ ] Reproducible Code: Is the GitHub repository or Kaggle notebook clean, commented, and "one-click" runnable?

Pólya Step 4: Looking Back
Before hitting "Submit," the council recommends one final review: Does the solution feel "Human-Centered"? If the tech feels too heavy and the human impact feels like an afterthought, the judges will notice. Ensure the video shows the interaction between the healthcare worker and the patient, not just code on a screen.
